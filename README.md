# Simple portfolio layout

Realy simple responsive layout which I create during frontend course. This site was created with:
- HTML5
- SASS

## Demo:

I can see site in action under this [link](https://dawid93.github.io/SimplePortfolioLayout/)

## wtf-gulp-starter

`npm install -g gulp-cli`

`npm install`

`gulp`

To publish your page using github pages use `npm run deploy`
